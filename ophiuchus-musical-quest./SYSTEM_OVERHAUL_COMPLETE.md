# 🚀 Major System Overhaul - Complete

## Summary of All Changes

### 1. **Database Models Updated** ✅

#### UserProfile Model (NEW)
- Location: `lib/models/UserProfile.ts`
- Tracks completed games history
- Stores total points and games played
- Records Ophiuchus identities for each completed quest

#### GameSession Model (UPDATED)
- Added `totalPoints` field
- Added `finalGuessAttempts` (max 3)
- Changed `ophiuchusIdentity` from string to object {title, description, imageUrl}
- Added to IRoomClue:
  - `points` field
  - `revealedSong` field (ISong object)
  - `emotionalSituation` field (for Aurora)

### 2. **Session Management** ✅

#### Big Bang Route (`app/api/bigbang/route.ts`)
- NOW DELETES existing active sessions before creating new one
- Only ONE active session per user at a time
- Logs old session deletion

#### GameStateProvider (`components/providers/game-state-provider.tsx`)
- Checks if session exists in DB on mount
- Clears localStorage if session is completed or not found
- "Continue Journey" only shows if active session exists

### 3. **Room Reveals & Points System** ✅

#### Nebula Room (`app/api/rooms/nebula/route.ts`)
**Concept**: Riddle challenge with multiple attempts
**Points System**:
- First attempt correct: 100 points
- Second attempt correct: 50 points
- Third attempt correct: 25 points
- All attempts failed: 0 points

**Reveal Logic**:
- ✅ REVEALS nebula song after correct guess
- ✅ REVEALS nebula song after 3 failed attempts
- Returns full song object with id, name, artists, album, imageUrl

#### Comet Room (`app/api/rooms/comet/route.ts`)
**Concept**: Timed lyric flash with ONE CHANCE
**Points System**:
- Correct: 100 points
- Wrong: 0 points

**Reveal Logic**:
- ✅ ALWAYS REVEALS comet song after one attempt (correct or wrong)
- No clue if wrong, only song reveal
- Instant completion after single guess

#### Aurora Room (`app/api/rooms/aurora/route.ts` + `functions/roomLogic/aurora.ts`)
**Concept**: COMPLETELY REDESIGNED ✨
**New Mechanic**:
1. LLM generates random emotional situation (breakup, first love, crushing, adulting, etc.)
2. Generates realistic audio (max 1 min) of person in that situation
3. Player hears audio and suggests a song from Spotify to help/comfort them
4. LLM rates song relevance (0-10):
   - "The Night We Met" for crying after breakup: 9-10 (great match!)
   - "Jingle Bells" for crying after breakup: 1-2 (terrible match!)

**Points System**:
- Score 9-10: 100 points
- Score 7-8: 75 points
- Score 5-6: 50 points
- Score 3-4: 25 points
- Score 0-2: 0 points

**Pass Threshold**: Score >= 7 to get clue and complete room
**Attempts**: Up to 3 attempts allowed

**Emotional Situations Include**:
- Heartbroken after breakup
- Experiencing first love
- Crushing on someone
- Yearning for someone far away
- Struggling with adulting
- Feeling lost/searching for meaning
- Celebrating achievement
- Dealing with loneliness
- Missing someone deeply
- Feeling nostalgic
- Going through transition
- Healing from emotional pain

#### Cradle Room (TODO)
- Add points system
- Add reveal logic

#### Nova Room (TODO)
- Add points system
- Add reveal logic

### 4. **Final Guess System** ✅ (Updated Schema, Route TODO)

**New Rules**:
- Maximum 3 attempts to guess cosmic song
- Tracks `finalGuessAttempts` in GameSession
- After 3rd wrong guess: Game Over (no Ophiuchus identity)
- On correct guess:
  - Generates Ophiuchus identity (title, description, imageUrl)
  - Calculates total points from all rooms
  - Saves completed game to UserProfile
  - DELETES GameSession from database
  - Creates history record in UserProfile

### 5. **Frontend Updates Needed** 🚧
